title: The Danger of Paula White in the White House
---

[Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7933365/Donald-Trumps-spiritual-adviser-Paula-White-calls-satanic-pregnancies-miscarry.html)

> President Donald Trump's televangelist spiritual adviser sparked outrage after praying in a sermon for Jesus Christ to 'command all satanic pregnancies to miscarry right now.' 
>
> Florida pastor Paula White, 53, who has a job in the White House and has been close to Trump for 18 years, said: 'We declare that anything that's been conceived in satanic wombs, that it will miscarry, it will not be able to carry forth any plan of destruction, any plan of harm.'

Of all the mistakes in judgement Donald Trump has made in office (and there have been many) I think one of the worst is appointing this charlatan as his "spiritual advisor." 

Giving her prominence and the backing of the President damages the Christian witness by making her seem to speak for all Christians.

I pray that the world would see her for who she truly is and that the Lord would open their eyes to recognize this wolf in sheep's clothing.

## Hi, I’m Kevin

I’m a Christian, husband, and father from a small town in Wisconsin.

My whole life I have been better at writing than talking. I've found it helps me clarify my thoughts and more clearly explain what I'm thinking. It helps me think through things and make sense of the world.

So that’s what I hope to do here. Think through current topics, ancient topics, and everything in between. Be it original writing, or curated items from other, smarter people, you'll get a little glimpse into my way of looking at the world.

Won’t you join me as I think out loud about matters of faith, culture, politics, and anything else that I find interesting?

## Hi, I’m Kevin

I’m a Christian, husband, and father from a small town in Wisconsin.

The Bible tells us we are to "take every thought captive for Christ." Now, I am using that slightly out of context, but I think it's a good summary for how our faith should impact our lives. Every thought we have, about any topic, should be thought through the lens of our faith in Christ.

So that’s what I hope to do here. Think through current topics, ancient topics, and everything in between. Be it original writing, or curated items from other (smarter) people, you'll get a little glimpse into my way of looking at the world.

Won’t you join me as I think out loud about matters of faith, culture, politics, and anything else that I find interesting?

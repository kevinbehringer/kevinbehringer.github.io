## Hi, I’m Kevin

I’m a Christian, husband, and father from a small town in Wisconsin.

My whole life I have been better at writing than talking. As I’m sure plenty of people will attest, they’d rather I had written a letter than stood there talking to them. At least then it would have been easier to ignore what I was saying...

The point is, I’ve always found that writing helps me to clarify my thoughts. When I take the time to write things down, I tend to have more clarity and am better able to get my point across. So that’s what I hope to do here. Think through current topics, ancient topics, and everything in between.

Won’t you join me as I think out loud about matters of faith, culture, politics, and anything else that I find interesting?

Matt Walsh saying we can't fight things like abortion by appealing to the bible.

Something I've struggled with, beucase it's tough to think that someone will be convinced by an arugment that appeals to a standard the other person doesn't believe in.

But, given how violently people will hold to their beliefs that abortion is a fundamental human (well female humans at least) right, convincing people with logic likely won't do it either.

People need changed hearts.

People need to be saved.

And, for that, we desperately need to use the bible.

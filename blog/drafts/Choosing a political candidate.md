 # Choosing a political candidate
In 2016 I, like many other Christians, struggled to decide who would receive our vote for president. Now, the jaded among you may just assume that Christians are always Republicans, but this is not the case. Sure, for some they default to the Republican Party, often because the other side represents much of what we are opposed to, but Christianity and Republicanism are no synonyms - regardless of what some may say.

As the presidential primary plodded on, it became clear that Donald Trump would be the Republican nominee, causing a crisis of conscience for many Christians - myself included. The news reports, audio recordings, rumors of marital infidelity, and overall boorish behavior inconsistent with a Christian worldview made the idea of casting a vote for Trump difficult to swallow.

At the same time we asked ourself what the alternative was. Voting for a party that promotes and celebrates the murder of unborn children is a nonstarter. It’s not even in the realm of possibility. For everyone who says we shouldn’t be “one issue voters,” I say, when the issue is abortion, we must. 

So, that left us in a quandary, didn’t it? 

We couldn’t vote for the pro-death party, but we felt uncomfortable voting for a less-than-moral (putting it lightly) candidate on the right. Many did like I did. We felt that preventing the future policies of Hillary Clinton and what they would mean for the fate of the unborn especially, and had to stomach the idea of voting for Trump.

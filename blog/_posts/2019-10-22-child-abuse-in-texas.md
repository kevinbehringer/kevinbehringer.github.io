title: The Horrifying Case of James Younger

[Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/texas-father-blocked-from-stopping-gender-transition-of-son-james-7-to-girl-called-luna)

>A jury in Texas returned a verdict on Monday that will prevent a Texas dad from intervening in the gender transition of his 7-year-old son.

As a father of a 7-year-old boy, who bounces between wanting to be a ninja and a zombie, I can't imagine allowing him to make a decision that will alter his life and body forever. It's my job as his father to help guide him to an understanding of the world - and help him understand that he is, in fact, not a zombie. That's an easy explanation - he can't be something fictional. But, how much more important is it for parents to guide their children that, no matter their feelings (which can lead them astray), they cannot be anything but what God has made them.

In the Texas case, it's not a parent's failure to guide their child that is at issue - it's something much worse. In this case, a parent is actively influencing their child to reject how he was made by God, and doing so (seemingly) to fulfill her own desires to have a daughter rather than a son. Add to the fact that the other parent is rightly trying to protect his child and is being prevented from doing so by the courts, and you have a sad story unraveling in the life of a 7-year-old boy.

We've seen this [throughout](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/28/world/europe/uk-alfie-evans-dead.html) [the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Gard_case), cases of courts holding up their own activist interest above the the interest of the parent - with disastrous results. While these cases sadly resulted in the death of the children, the case in Texas is one that will force life-altering changes on a child who will have to live with them for the rest of his life. 

Another telling point in the article is a quote from Rebekka Ouer, who is associated with Dallas Rainbow Therapy:

>"This is a letter of recommendation that my client, James Younger, aka Luna, begin the process of becoming a patient of the GENECIS clinic so that she can receive a full psychological assessment for gender dysphoria and potentially take hormone blockers."

What is striking about that quote is this woman admits that this is a condition warranting a psychological assessment, yet the court is forcing a parent to go against their will and allow their child to be irrevocably mutilated at the age of seven. 

In this age of celebrating sin unashamedly, it's no surprise that this too would be celebrated. People who want to continue to revel in their sin of trangenderism will hold this poor boy up as a poster child, further abusing him for their own gain. 

Sadly, the father who is trying to fulfill his God-given duty to protect his son, seems to on course to not only lose that battle, but lose his child in the process. This court, this mother, and everyone celebrating this decision, should be ashamed and punished for their failure to protect the innocence of this poor boy.

This is child abuse, plain and simple, and it's time the world wakes up and puts and end to it. Unfortunately, in our society, that's unlikely to happen.

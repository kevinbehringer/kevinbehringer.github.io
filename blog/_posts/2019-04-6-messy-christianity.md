>These two experiences have remained with me, not only because they were uncomfortable but because they challenged me to reflect on my attitude and my perception of a God of love and justice. I call myself a follower of Jesus and I even work full-time for an organisation that serves the poor and marginalised. I have many friends who are ‘missionaries’ – who have left the comfort of their homes and countries to embrace new communities in obedience to God’s calling.

Good stuff

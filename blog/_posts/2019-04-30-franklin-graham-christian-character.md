title: Franklin Graham and the Importance of Christian Character

[David French](https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/franklin-graham-and-the-high-cost-of-the-lost-evangelical-witness/)

> Franklin Graham is under fire today. He should be. His double standards have cost the church. This mistake should not define him — he has done much good and preached the Gospel faithfully for many years — but it should grieve him. Through his blatant hypocrisy, he has earned his critics’ wrath.

French gets to the heart of my first thought when I read the story about Franklin Graham's criticism of Pete Buttigieg. Yes, it is right to point out that homosexuality is a sin and marriage is between a man and a woman, but when you're on record defending a serial philanderer like Donald Trump and implying his sins are to be overlooked, then you lose credibility and damage your witness. Something we all need to remember.

> Democratic Gov. Tony Evers vetoed four abortion bills Friday, including one that would require doctors to provide basic medical care to newborn babies who survive abortions.
>
> The legislature passed the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, sending it to the governor for final approval. Evans, who supports abortion on demand, [previously said the legislation is a waste of time](https://www.lifenews.com/2019/04/23/wisconsin-governor-tony-evers-will-veto-bill-to-stop-infanticide-care-for-babies-born-alive/) and he would veto it. The state Senate does not have enough votes to override his veto.

> “We have all sorts of issues to deal with in the state of Wisconsin and to pass a bill that is redundant seems to be not a productive use of time,” the governor said in April. “And clearly I ran on the belief — and I still believe — that women should be able to make choices about their health care. But this deals with a specific issue that’s already been resolved.”
>
> Today, Evers continued calling infanticide health care.
>
> “Everyone should have access to quality, affordable health care, and that includes reproductive health care,” Evers said in a statement. “Politicians shouldn’t be in the business of interfering with decisions made between patients and their healthcare providers.”

Apparently, this was to be the first redundant law on the books. 

The governor can hide behind that lie all he wants, but all of us in Wisconsin know the truth. He wants women to be be able to kill their children at any point they choose, with no limits.

Many of us knew this would be the type of governor he would be (at least when he's awake), but it is still heartbreaking to see it play out in front of us. When we can't even protect a baby born alive, what have we become?
